## Description
This is a fully-responsive, dynamic page made with sequelize-cli and handlebars. Currently it's just displaying the courseswork I did in Northwestern's Code Bootcamp, but it is designed from the ground up to show off other projects as well. Eventually, I plan to upload my leather masks and my arduino microcontroller projects, as well as some of my music composing work. I made sure that there will be a place for all of it!
